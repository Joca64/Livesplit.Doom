LiveSplit Auto Splitter for PrBoom+

As the name states, this is an auto splitter for PrBoom+. In order to use it, simply add a Scriptable Auto Splitter to your layout and browse to the location of this ASL script.

Since I'm not using ingame tick count, it will probably be slightly off-sync with the actual game timer, but since the DOOM community always records demos it shouldnt really matter. Splits are usually just for reference while doing runs. I mainly did this because I'm lazy and cant be bothered to constantly split when finishing levels.

Note: This was only tested with PrBoom+ 2.5.1.3, but may work with other versions.
